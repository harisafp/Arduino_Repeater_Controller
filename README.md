# Arduino_vox_repeater

The arduino sketch begins with some comments showing sample data that I used for some of my testing.  The pin numbers will vary depending on your Arduino or ATTINY and how you wired up the circuit to which pins.

The first section you need to modify is the #define statments starting with the CALLSIGN field.
The other section you need to modify is the first two sections in setup() the lines for radioA and radioB settings.
